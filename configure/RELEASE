# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE ANY PATHS in this file or make API changes to
# any modules it refers to, you should do a "make rebuild" in
# this application's top level directory.
#
# The EPICS build process does not check dependencies against
# any files from outside the application, so it is safest to
# rebuild it completely if any modules it depends on change.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it may ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# Defines the prebuilt bundle location.
# This item is set when this module is built as part of the bundle.
# Leave blank within the source code repository (perforce).

BUNDLE=

# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
#SNCSEQ = $(BUNDLE)/epics/seq

# Used for test app only
#
AUTOSAVE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/autosave
AUTOSAVESETUP=$(BUNDLE)/epics/autosaveSetup
CONCAT=$(BUNDLE)/epics/concat

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
#
EPICS_BASE=$(BUNDLE)/epics/base

# end
